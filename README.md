# candy-museum

This webpage uses Bootstrap for the layout of a "candy museum" mockup site. 
The purpose of this site was to to get familiar with the Bootstrap CSS Framework while developing the site which is also used in the final capstone project of the course, Yelp-Camp.

This project was part of a course, "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele on Udemy.
